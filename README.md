Overview: 

Predictive Modeling
This project develops a machine learning model to predict county-level food insecurity rates based on factors like Farm Bill funding allocations, economic indicators, and climate/crop data. The goal is to identify counties most at risk for high food insecurity in order to guide Farm Bill funding and interventions.

Data 
The model uses the following datasets:

farm_bill_allocations.csv: Farm Bill spending amounts by county and program
food_insecurity_by_county.csv: Food insecurity rates by county
county_economic_indicators.csv: County-level economic data like median income, unemployment rate
climate_indicators_by_county.csv: County-level climate and crop yield data

Modeling
The predict_food_insecurity.py script executes the following steps:

Loads and merges the datasets into one DataFrame
Selects key features for modeling
Splits data into training and test sets
Trains a linear regression model
Evaluates model performance on test data
Makes predictions and calculates error metrics
Identifies high-error counties to prioritize
Saves model to file for operationalization
Key metrics are coefficient of determination (R-squared) to evaluate model fit and mean squared error to quantify prediction error.

Usage
To run the model:

python predict_food_insecurity.py
This will output model evaluation results and a list of high-priority counties.

The trained model object is saved to food_insecurity_model.pkl for making predictions on new data.

Next Steps
Possible ways to improve the model:

Try different ML algorithms like random forests
Tune model hyperparameters
Incorporate additional data like demographics
Develop ensemble methods to combine multiple models

Image Classification for Hunger Analysis

Overview
This project trains an image classifier to identify signs of malnutrition from photographs. The goal is to recognize three classes - healthy, malnourished, or starving. This can help aid organizations in analyzing hunger issues through visual data.

Data
The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images showing people with varying levels of nutrition. The data is split into training and validation sets.

Image augmentation is used to expand the training data by applying transformations like rotations and flips.

Model Architecture
The model uses transfer learning with a VGG16 convolutional base pre-trained on ImageNet. The top layers are re-trained to classify hunger levels.

Key techniques:

Frozen convolutional base for transfer learning
Added dense layers for classification
Lower learning rate
Early stopping for regularization
Training
The model is trained for 30 epochs with a batch size of 32. Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of 1e-5.

Training stops early if validation loss does not improve for 3 epochs.

Evaluation
Accuracy and loss are measured on the validation set. A confusion matrix can show classification errors.

Usage
To train the model:
python hunger_classification.py
This will output accuracy metrics.

To make predictions on new images:

import model

test_img = load_img('test.jpg') 
prediction = model.predict(test_img)
Improvement Ideas
Fine-tune hyperparameters like learning rate
Use more training data
Try different CNN architectures
Address class imbalance
Ensemble methods
